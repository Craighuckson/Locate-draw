To design an interactive drawing program using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, you would typically need to create a set of classes that represent various objects and concepts in your program. Here are some of the key classes and concepts you would need:

1. **Canvas Class**:
   - This class represents the drawing area where users can interact with the program. It would manage the graphical elements and handle user input events.

2. **Shape Classes**:
   - Classes like `Rectangle`, `Circle`, `Line`, `Text`, etc., to represent different drawing shapes. These classes should have methods to draw themselves on the canvas and handle user interactions like resizing, moving, and editing.

3. **Tool Classes**:
   - Classes to represent different drawing tools such as the pen, brush, eraser, and selection tools. Each tool would have methods to perform specific actions on the canvas.

4. **Color Class**:
   - A class to represent colors, allowing users to select and apply colors to their drawings.

5. **Layer Class**:
   - If your drawing program supports layers, you would need a class to manage layers. Each layer may contain a collection of shapes and can be rearranged, hidden, or locked.

6. **User Interface (UI) Classes**:
   - Classes for creating the user interface components, like buttons, menus, and dialogs. These classes would manage user interactions with the program's tools and options.

7. **File Management Classes**:
   - Classes for saving and loading drawings. These classes would handle file formats, serialization, and deserialization of drawing data.

8. **Event Handling Classes**:
   - Classes for handling user input events (e.g., mouse clicks, keyboard input) and triggering appropriate actions in response.

9. **Undo/Redo Class**:
   - A class to implement an undo and redo mechanism, allowing users to revert and restore changes made to their drawings.

10. **Settings and Preferences Class**:
    - A class to manage user preferences, such as default colors, line thickness, and other settings.

11. **Utility Classes**:
    - These include utility classes for mathematical calculations (e.g., for geometry and collision detection) and any other helper classes needed to support the main functionality.

12. **Main Application Class**:
    - The entry point of your application, responsible for initializing the canvas, tools, UI components, and handling program flow.

When designing these classes, you should follow OOP principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Encapsulation involves hiding the internal details of a class and exposing a clean interface. Inheritance can be used to create a hierarchy of related classes (e.g., different shapes inheriting from a common `Shape` class). Polymorphism allows you to treat different objects (e.g., shapes) uniformly through interfaces or base classes.

Remember that good software design also involves proper planning, architecture, and design patterns to ensure a robust and maintainable drawing program.
